      <div>
        <p>Basic endless runner game developed for the Play Station 5 through the use of a dev kit. </p>
        <p>For one of my university modules we have to use a dev kit to make a Switch/PS5 game and I chose the PS5. As I signed an NDA I do not have access to my project code.</p>
        <h3>What I learned:</h3>
        <p>
          Going in blind with no documentation. Figuring out how it's coded through a mix of PS4 documentation and it's demos. 
          A lot of researching things I didn't know, went down a spiral just to change an image which was a .gnf file.
        </p>
        <p>
          In essence one a .gnf file is used to load images and there was a lot of misinformation during my researching leading me to look up a PS4 hobbiest forum page talking about the
          .gnf file. They recommended a program called Noetis however I wasn't able to get it working and moved on. With more research I stumbled upon image2gnf which is an executable
          file from the PS4 SDK, searching for this term I found PS4 SDK information and gave me the current process which now would be to convert a .png to a .dds to a .gnf. However,
          downloading the PS4 SDK tool didn't reap any rewards and I stopped trying to figure out the .gnf file.
        </p>

        <p>
          After trying different github applications, I eventually gave up and by chance looking at the PS4 documentation it has information that files get converted through code but
           couldn't find anything to do with that through searching the entire solution and thus gave up with trying to change the black background to a white background. Just 
           changing a simple image to something else was quite a task and in the end I couldn't change a PlayStation file to look like something else.

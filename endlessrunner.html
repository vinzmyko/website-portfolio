        <p>Basic endless runner game developed for the Play Station 5 through the use of a dev kit. </p>
        <p>For one of my university modules we have to use a dev kit to make a Switch/PS5 game and I chose the PS5. As I signed an NDA I do not have access to my project code.</p>
        <h3>What I learned:</h3>
        <p>
          Going in blind with no documentation. Figuring out how it's coded through a mix of PS4 documentation and it's demos. 
          A lot of researching things I didn't know, went down a spiral just to change an image which was a .gnf file.
        </p>
        <p>
          One would have to use .gnf files as that is how they loaded the image. I went through a weird rabbit hole when I was researching how to simply change an existing image 
          to something else. Like changing the maze game image to a title screen for my game. I first searched up what a .gnf file was and got information about it being a gluonpilot 
          navigation file which was made by Tom Pycke. This didn't seem right as it didn't relate to images and game development at all. I then proceeded to research what a .gnf file
           was through console forums leading me to Noetis. A program for viewing PS4 files and changing some file formats. I attempted to use this software however, it said exported
            however, nothing happened so I moved on.

        </p>
        <p>
          image2gnf which is an executable file from the PS4 SDK  tools. 
          Searching for image2gnf I found PS4 SDK information and tried to torrent the PS4 SDK but it didn’t work and figured out there were PS4 SDK files on the S:/ drive which are the PS5 files. The current process now would be to convert a .png to a .dds to a .gnf.

I downloaded a texture converter on my laptop through github that converts images to gnf however unfortunately that needed some SDK files meaning that it didn’t work. Since all the files required weren’t all available.

        </p>
        <p>
          After trying different github applications, I eventually gave up and by chance looking at the PS4 documentation it has information that files get converted through code but
           couldn't find anything to do with that through searching the entire solution and thus gave up with trying to change the black background to a white background. Just 
           changing a simple image to something else was quite a task and in the end I couldn’t change a PlayStation file to look like something else.
